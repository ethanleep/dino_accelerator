# Dino Accelerator
 
This is a semi full recreation of the Google Chrome dinosaur game in Verilog. It has a clock and "jump" input and a hsync, vsync, and 4 bit VGA color output. It runs on a 25.175MHz clock. I do plan to continue working on it and adding features in the future. The code can still be largely optimized but at the moment it works well.
