# Dino Accelerator
 
This is a semi full recreation of the Google Chrome dinosaur game in Verilog. It has a clock and "jump" input and a hsync, vsync, and 4 bit VGA color output. It runs on a 25.175MHz clock. I do plan to continue working on it and adding features in the future. The code can still be largely optimized but at the moment it works well.

It was initially designed in Vivado to be used on the Digilent Arty A7-35 board with a Digilent PmodVGA module but it should be easy to port it to other platforms.
